ESP32 Android Studio

This project explain how to receive data from ESP32 and show the value on Android App

and send data to ESP32 from Android App which we build for turning on LED or something

Just for infomartion, ESP32 and ESP8266 have same principle work also programming.
But, if u try to use this program and compiling to ESP8266 change library " #include wifi.h" into "#include esp8266wifi.h"
